  team: Andrew, Colin, Hadi, Andrew and Zeeshan, September 2015
  blurb: Node Rover is a group final project from Makers Academy. The original task was to build some form of robot that could be controlled wirelessely. The team decided to make a robot based on the Mars rover (4 engines with continuous tracks). It was built from scratch, and you can control it via a Node.js server. The goal was to have a mobile first web app which could control several aspects of the rover (motor movement, claw, camera pan tilt bracket) over wifi.

  team: Elliot, Javier, Spike, and Ethel, August 2015
  blurb: Around the world, around 8000 tweets are sent per second. But what do people tweet about? The project visualises the moods of world regions based on tweets. Each word is analysed for emotional content using the AFINN database and given a score, e.g. +3 for 'happy' and -2 for 'sad'. The average score of a tweet determines its colour. Finally, the tweet is plotted on a HTML Canvas using the coordinates it was sent from.
