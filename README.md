# Makers Academy Beta Site

[ ![Codeship Status for makersacademy/site-mvp](https://codeship.com/projects/e5781160-fcad-0132-3d45-5a06a30fe976/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.com/projects/87550)

Our new-look website, currently viewable at [http://beta.makersacademy.com](http://beta.makersacademy.com).

## Why are we open sourcing our website?

Here at Makers Academy we believe in practising what we preach - which means both open-sourcing code wherever possible and writing code that we're proud to showcase to the world. We wanted our new website to be open so people can both see the principles that drive our code, and as a learning tool for students and graduates alike.
