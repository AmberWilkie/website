  %article
    %p
      The following terms and conditions apply to all students accepted to study at Craft Academy (run by Pragmatic Sweden AB (559027-5002)
      Holtermansgatan 1D, 411 29 Gothenburg, Sweden). By applying for a Craft Academy course or paying a deposit against Craft Academy course
      fees you confirm acceptance of these terms and conditions as legally binding on you until successful completion by you of the course
      (unless terminated or cancelled earlier in accordance with these terms and conditions).

    %h3 Course Attendance and Conduct
    %p Craft Academy courses are intensive courses that require a serious commitment from all students. Craft Academy wants to ensure that all students on its courses have the best possible opportunity to succeed and therefore reserves the right to suspend from the course any student who in any way disrupts the course environment. We hope that our selection process means we will never have to do this, of course. Other than in the event of serious disruptive behavior we will seek to resolve any issues by way of coaching and dialogue before taking more serious steps.

    %p If, despite our careful selection process, we find (acting reasonably and having undertaken a thorough investigation) that a student is failing to keep up with the demands of the course they have chosen, and after consulting with the student we decide that the student is not likely to successfully complete the course, we reserve the right to require the student to leave the course. Provided we are satisfied, acting reasonably and taking all reasonable circumstances into consideration, that the student has made a good faith effort to succeed on the course we will refund a pro-rata amount of the course fees paid by a student who is required to leave (based on the number of full weeks of the course remaining after the student was required to leave, as a percentage of the total number of course weeks) .In any other circumstances the terms of section 4 (“Payment of Fees if the course is not completed”) below will apply.

    %p Students will be required to comply with all rules and regulations of Craft Academy or the premises in which Craft Academy courses are held. Craft Academy reserves the right to exclude any student for failure to do so.

    %h3 Course Content and Structure
    %p Each Craft Academy course will last for 12 calendar weeks (Monday-Friday, including bank holidays), and Craft Academy may stipulate that up to one calendar day during that period is reserved for student self-study rather than tuition. In addition, Craft Academy courses will evolve. The content, structure and methods used in each course is subject to a constant process of review and improvement. This means that the course that you attend may not be identical to previous courses, and, whilst it will be materially the same, may not be identical to that described on the Craft Academy website.

    %h3 Deposit

    %p Anyone accepted on a Craft Academy course is required to pay a non-refundable 8 400 SEK deposit to secure their place on the course, which will be deducted from the total course fees owed. Craft Academy operates a “first come first served” policy so once you have paid your deposit we will reserve a place for you on our next available course (subject to your payment of the course fees as described below).

    %h3 Course Fees

    %p Following payment of the deposit, students can choose one of two payment plans for course fees, as follows:

    %h4 A. Standard Payment Plan – 100% not later than ten days prior to commencement of the course

    %p The student must pay 100% of the published fee for the relevant course (less the deposit) so that it is received in Craft Academy’s bank account not later than ten days before the commencement of the course. The fee is non-refundable if the student withdraws from the course within the ten days prior to the start of the course.

    %p If payment in full is not received by Craft Academy in its bank account not later than ten days before the commencement of a course Craft Academy may, at its option, re-allocate the place reserved for the student to a wait-listed student in which case the original student will no longer be able to attend the course and will not be entitled to be repaid his/her deposit.

    %h4 B. Advance Payment Plan – 90% in advance, 10% discount applies

    %p The student must pay 90% of the published fee for the relevant course (less the deposit) so that it is received in Craft Academy’s bank account not later than thirty days before the commencement of the course. The fee is non-refundable if the student withdraws from the course within the thirty days prior to the start of the course. By making this advance payment, the student is given a discount of 10% on the published fee and no further payment is due. Any student not making the advance payment within the stated deadline is required to follow the Standard Payment Plan referred to above.

    %p If payment of 90% of the course fee is not received in Craft Academy’s bank account within thirty days before the commencement of a course, Craft Academy may, at its option, re-allocate the place reserved for the student to a wait-listed student in which case the original student will no longer be able to attend the course and will not be entitled to be repaid his/her deposit.

    %h3 Payment method and external payment plan options

    %p Craft Academy will direct students to the payment services provider used by Craft Academy so that the student can pay the deposit and course fees online. Alternatively, students can pay the deposit and course fees by bank transfer to Craft Academy’s nominated bank account.

    %p Third party providers may, from time to time, offer loans to prospective Craft Academy students. These providers are entirely independent of Craft Academy and Craft Academy assumes no responsibility or liability for the loans or services that they offer. In particular, students must undertake their own due diligence on each provider and the terms of any loans or services that they offer.

    %h3 Payment of Fees if the course is not completed

    %p If a student fails to complete a course, Craft Academy reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to charge the student the full amount of fees outstanding (being the full course fee less the deposit paid) immediately following confirmation that the student will not be completing the course for any reason.  In exceptional circumstances Craft Academy may, in its sole discretion, agree to waive payment of part or all of the outstanding fees.

    %h3 Refund Policy

    %p Any deposit or course fee paid by a student in accordance with the payment plan selected by the student set out in section 3 above is non-refundable unless the course on which the student is enrolled is cancelled (whether prior to the course commencing, or after its commencement) by Craft Academy, in which case any course fee which has been paid by the student will be refunded in full.  If a course is temporarily suspended for a period of less than one month no course fees will be refunded. If a course is suspended for a period of longer than one month students enrolled on that course will be given the option of continuing the course when it resumes or receiving a pro-rata refund of course fees for the suspended part of the course (based on the number of full weeks of the course that were suspended, as a percentage of the total number of course weeks).

    %h3 Pre-course

    %p Craft Academy may, at its discretion, require students to complete a pre-course prior to the start of the full course for which course fees are payable. This pre-course will be provided at no additional cost to students and is intended to ensure that each student is suitable to participate in the full course. It is envisaged that each pre-course will last for 15 hours per week for four weeks prior to the commencement of the relevant full course. If a student fails to complete the pre-course, or Craft Academy reasonably determines that the student is not suitable to participate in the full course (including if he/she does not pass any final technical test set by Craft Academy), the student shall not be permitted to participate in the full course (and shall not be entitled to a refund of any pre-paid deposit but shall be entitled to a full refund of any other course fees already paid).

    %h3 Right to Study

    %p
      All students must have the right to study in Sweden/EU under applicable rules, and hold a current visa if necessary.

    %p As a general rule you will not need a visa if you hold a passport issued by any country in the European Economic Area (EEA), any of the Scandinavian countries or Switzerland.

    %p Please note that Craft Academy is not currently an accredited institution for the purposes of the “student visitor” category.

    %p Students will be required to produce an EEA or Swiss passport on enrolment on a course.  If you intend to rely on other documents you should provide full details to Craft Academy when applying for a course.


    %h3 Liability

    %p If for any reason Craft Academy cancels a planned course after a student has been accepted on the course Craft Academy will refund to the student any deposit and course fees paid by the student but will have no further liability to the student.

    %p Except in respect of death or personal injury caused by Craft Academy's negligence or Craft Academy’s fraud, Craft Academy shall not be liable (to the extent able to be excluded at law) to any student by reason of any representation (unless fraudulent), or any implied warranty, condition or other term, or any duty at common law, or under the express terms of the contract for any loss of profit or any indirect, special or consequential loss, damage, costs, expenses or other claims (whether caused by the negligence of Craft Academy, its servants or agents or otherwise) which arise out of or in connection with the provision of the Craft Academy course and the entire liability of Craft Academy under or in connection with the course shall not exceed the amount of Craft Academy's charges for the course on which the student is or has applied to be enrolled.

    %p Craft Academy shall not be liable to the student or be deemed in breach of contract by reason of any delay or failure to perform any of Craft Academy's obligations in relation to the course if this was due to any cause beyond Craft Academy's reasonable control.
