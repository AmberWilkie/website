        Your course fees include all instruction, materials, and continued support before and after the bootcamp with technical and career assistance. We provide all the necessary tools to develop efficiently - software licenses, a functional and ergonomic work environment - even a computer for you to use during the course, if you don't have one. The course fee also includes the Swedish VAT tax of 25%.
      %p.copy--left
        We also proudly offer a 10% discount to female bootcamp participants. There is an unfortunate deficiency of female programmers in the industry and we want to do everything we can to turn that statistic around.

        Finances shouldn't stop anyone from fulfilling their dream of becoming a programmer. We encourage everyone to contact us to discuss payment options, including our flexible deposit and payment schedule.
