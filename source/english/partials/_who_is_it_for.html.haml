          You do not need prior coding experience. You do not need to be a computer wiz or have studied computer science. You need to be hungry. We can teach anyone to code, if they are focused and committed.

        We believe that traditional education teaches students to do well on tests, rather than give them actual knowledge and experience.
        At Craft Academy, we provide neither grades nor diplomas. Instead, we help you develop the tools you need to be successful. We'll give you the skills to teach yourself new coding practices, resources to utilize, the conventions used throughout the industry so that you can thrive in a real workplace, and advise you throughout the bootcamp on workflow, work/life balance and best practices.
        In that way, our course is unique, not just in intensity, but in approach. We provide a structured daily learning plan, projects, assignments and challenges, and continually push your limits to achieve the fastest learning possible. All in twelve weeks.

              %td You can dedicate 100% of your time, energy and attention to learning coding as a craft. You can only get out of bootcamp what you put in. If you give us everything we've got, we can make you a programmer. But we need you <i>in</i>.
              %td You have to work a full-time job during the bootcamp. Of course we understand that everyone has to work to survive, but there simply isn't enough time in the day to be at a job and also participating in a bootcamp.
            %tr
              %td You have found traditional education constraining, frustrating, or boring. We don't care the slightest bit what your exam scores were in school. We care about your passion, your drive, and your dedication.
              %td You are at a very different time zone than Sweden. We have twice-daily meetings and very frequent demos and pair-programming sessions - all of which take place in real-time. If our afternoon is your middle of the night, we may run into serious logistical issues.

            %tr
              %td You love learning new things and thrive in fast-paced environments.
              %td You're not interested in coding. Don't enroll in bootcamp simply because there are so many jobs in the tech industry. Your passion must drive your choice.
