      %h1 Curriculum
      %p We believe that teaching consists of much more than just the materials we provide and the curriculum we created. We currently use a mixture of workshops, exercises, projects, classroom break-out sessions and end of the week tests to help our students understand programming. The immersive environment, having expert teachers on hand all day, and pairing with other students are all key to our teaching process.
